you need three certificate files in this directory
1.) server.crt

signed cert for the server. If you use a Comodo cert paste the
cert at the top of the certificate chain and put that here

2.) server.key

private key for the server

3.) dhparam.pem  

Getting stronger than default Diffie/Hellman key exchange parameter is
required for to do good forward security. To generate this run, and wait a long
time for the file to be generated

    openssl dhparam -out dhparam.pem 4096
