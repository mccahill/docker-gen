This directory is where we put the config file that nginx uses to do proxying
and SSL termination. 

While there is a default.conf file here, you are probably going to have this 
overwritten if you are running the docker-gen container, because docker-gen uses 
a template to dynamically generate the config file in response to other containers 
being started and stopped.

Note that the default html is in the html sub directory and the ssl directory
is where you probably want to stash your site certificates
